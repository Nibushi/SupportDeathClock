### Get-SDCAllProductInfo

This command uses the [https://endoflife.date/api/v1/products/full](https://endoflife.date/docs/api/v1/#/Products/products_full) end point and returns a list of all the products maintained in the endoflife.date data, including all releases. To reduce the amount of data transferred it is preferable to use `Get-SDCAllProductInfo`.

```powershell
Get-SDCAllProductInfo
```

### Get-SDCProductInfo

This command can be in the following ways

```powershell
# This will return information regarding all versions of a product, in this case python
# ProductName uses an ArgumentCompleter, so you will be able to use tab completion to see all the possible product names
Get-SDCProductInfo -ProductName python

```

```powershell
# This will return information regarding a specific versions of a product, in this case python version 3.5
# Release uses an ArgumentCompleter, so you will be able to use tab completion to see all the possible versions of the product
Get-SDCProductInfo -ProductName python -Release 3.5
```

```powershell
# This will return information regarding the latest versions of a product, in this case python.
Get-SDCProductInfo -ProductName python -Latest
```
